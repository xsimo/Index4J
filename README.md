The static uncompressed javadoc html files are going to be transfered following protocols from the directory which name can be configured. Just set the realLibraryPath variable in the so called properties file (@see .gitignore). <br>
You can decide to serve the static content from outside of thy Apache¯Tomcat context, for instance (<i>exampli gratia</i> (e.g.)), directly through Microsoft IIS® or Apache¯HTTPd, or other transfer engines following the protocols, ..., as long as thy tomcat context needed write access.
